## An encyclopedia focused on KSHV

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the γ-herpesvirus subfamily. Its lifecycle primarily includes latent infection and lytic reactivation, KSHV has the ability to establish a lifelong persistent latent infection as a means of evading the host’s immune surveillance. KSHV is the causative agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD), and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS). 

Since its discovery, research on KSHV has rapidly progressed, but existing platforms lack comprehensiveness and specificity, and they do not provide efficient analysis tools tailored for KSHV. To study KSHV more effectively, we have developed KSHVbook (http://www.kshvbook.com), a specialized information-sharing platform dedicated to KSHV. This platform offers extensive information on gene, coding sequences (CDS), protein-coding. Besides, KSHVbook includes 35,010 transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), 342,010 KSHV miRNA-target relationship pairs, protein structures predicted by AlphaFold2, qPCR primers, and so on. Notably, we also develop analysis tools for regions, TFBSs, and miRNA target genes to discover previously unknown biological functions of KSHV.

Our platform provides a centralized resource for KSHV research by integrating multiple databases, offering accessible tools and simplifying data acquisition, thereby improve our understanding of KSHV biology. KSHVbook will continue to be updated and more features can be found on the website.
